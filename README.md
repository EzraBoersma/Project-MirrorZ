# Project-MirrorZ

# Welcome to Project Mirror Z!
-----
The Smart Mirror is designed with the purpose of providing a user-friendly technology interface that integrates with other smart devices found in the user's home - or even remotely.

> The Smart Mirror is an innovative step in the direction of building security-conscious technology into a work or home environment. 
This smart technology integrates directly into the array of devices in the user’s physical environment, rather than just in the users’ hands.
This proceeds to serve benefits such as interconnectivity and accessibility.

The unique purposes of this project include:
- Zoom video call conferencing on Raspberry Pi (hopefully as a browser hook-in inside MM^2)
- Including a touch display controller (with remote control and keyboard functions possible)
- A full suite of productivity applications. 
- we will try to incorporate an Amazon Echo, which will allow the use of custom voice controls.
